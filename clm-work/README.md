Objective : A videos portal for student to stream video for learning purpose.
Technology : nodejs
Things Done :
1. Added a click listener to the search button. 
2. Created a loop, that will loop through all the directories in the videos folder.
3. Display of all videos when button is clicked.

Brief explanation:

I worked on a search bar that will render to a user a particular video, he/she is searching for, When user types a search string and clicks the button. The program is going to loop through all the files in our videos directory and show the particular video or show all the videos in the case of no videos found.


Work is still in progress.
